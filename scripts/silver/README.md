## 1. Analyze & Explore
Before coding anything, explore the data in the **Bronze Layer**.

### Understand:
- The **content** and **structure** of each source table.  
- How different tables **relate** to one another.  

**Goal:** Build a mental map (or documentation) of your data sources.

---

## 2. Transform & Cleanse
Once data understanding is complete, start **coding the transformations**.

Focus on **data cleansing**, which usually takes the most time.

### Three-Step Workflow:
1. **Identify** data quality issues in the Bronze Layer (nulls, duplicates, wrong formats, inconsistencies, etc.).  
2. **Write transformations** to fix these issues.  
3. **Insert** the cleaned data into the **Silver Layer**.

---

## 3. Validate & Iterate
After loading data into the **Silver Layer**:

- **Validate** to ensure data quality is now solid.  
- If new issues appear → go back, adjust transformations, and re-run.  

This becomes a **cycle** between:
> Coding → Validating → Fixing → Re-validating

---

## 4. Document & Commit
Once everything’s validated:

- **Document** the final process.  
- **Commit** your work in **Git** (version control).

### Create Two Key Documents:
- **Data Flow Diagram (DFD):** shows how data moves from **source → Bronze → Silver**.  
- **Data Integration Diagram:** shows relationships between datasets and transformations.

---

## 5. Why Explore the Bronze Layer?
Because **understanding the data** is crucial for building a smart and accurate **Silver Layer**.

- The **Bronze Layer** was only about *ingesting* data, not understanding it.  
- The **Silver Layer** focuses on *meaning* and *relationships* — so exploration and documentation are essential before any transformation.
