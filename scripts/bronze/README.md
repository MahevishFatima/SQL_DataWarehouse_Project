## 🔍 Step 1: Analysis — Understanding the Source System

Before developing the Bronze Layer, the first and most important step is **analysis**.  
You don’t immediately start writing code — instead, you must first **understand the source system** you are connecting to the data warehouse.

### 🎯 Purpose

To gain a deep understanding of:

- The nature and structure of the source system.  
- How data is generated, stored, and accessed.  
- The best way to extract and load it into the data warehouse.

### 🗣️ Approach

The Data Engineer or Architect should **interview the source system experts** and ask multiple questions to learn:

- What kind of system it is (CRM, ERP, etc.)  
- What data formats it uses.  
- How frequently the data changes.  
- What access or security constraints exist.  

This step helps avoid integration issues and ensures efficient ETL pipeline design.

---

## ⚙️ Step 2: Data Ingestion — Connecting Source to Data Warehouse

Once the source systems are well-understood, the next focus is **data ingestion**.  
This means **building the bridge** between the source system and the data warehouse.

### 🧩 Key Objective

- Load data from the source into the **Bronze Layer**.  
- Preserve the data **exactly as it exists in the source system** (no transformations).

The Bronze Layer serves as the **raw data zone**, capturing all incoming data in its original form.

---

## 🧪 Step 3: Data Validation — Ensuring Data Quality

Once data ingestion scripts are ready and data is loaded, it’s time for **quality control**.

### ✅ Validation Steps

**Data Completeness Check:**  
Compare the number of records between the source system and the Bronze Layer.  
This ensures that no data has been lost during ingestion.

**Schema Check:**  
Validate that the table structure, column order, and data types match exactly between the source and the Bronze Layer.  
This ensures that data has landed correctly and maintains consistency.

---

## 🧾 Step 4: Documentation & Version Control

After successful ingestion and validation:

- **Document** all details — source connections, table mappings, and validation results.  
- **Commit** the scripts and documentation to **Git** for version control and collaboration.

> 🧠 Good documentation and versioning ensure your work is **traceable**, **maintainable**, and **reproducible**.

## 🧠 Understanding Source Systems Before Connecting to a Data Warehouse

Before connecting any source systems to a data warehouse, it’s crucial to first understand the sources.  
This helps ensure accurate extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) processes — avoiding costly mistakes later.

### 💬 Step 1: Meet with Source System Experts
- Schedule meetings with the experts or owners of the source systems.  
- Ask detailed questions about the data, its structure, and its business purpose.  
- Gaining deep knowledge early helps design efficient extraction scripts and reduces challenges later.

---

### 🏢 Step 2: Understand the Business Context and Ownership
- Learn the story behind the data — why it exists and how it’s used.  
- Identify who is responsible for the data (e.g., which IT or business department).  
- Understanding ownership helps in managing access, governance, and accountability.

---

### ⚙️ Step 3: Understand the Business Process It Supports
Identify which process the data supports:
- Customer transactions  
- Supply chain and logistics  
- Finance and reporting  

This helps determine the importance and sensitivity of the data.

---

### 📚 Step 4: Review System and Data Documentation
- Request existing documentation from the source team.  
- This documentation serves as your learning material and reference for future development.  
- It saves time when designing new data models or integrating additional systems.

---

### 🗃️ Step 5: Understand the Data Model
- Study the data model of the source system.  
- Ask for column and table descriptions and, if possible, a data catalog.  
- This helps you determine how to join and relate tables in the data warehouse.

---

### 🧩 Step 6: Understand the Architecture and Technology Stack
Identify where the data is stored:
- On-premises (e.g., SQL Server, Oracle)  
- Cloud-based (e.g., Azure, AWS, GCP)

Once you know the environment, discuss integration capabilities:
- APIs  
- Kafka or other streaming tools  
- File extractions  
- Direct database connections

---

### 🔄 Step 7: Define Extraction and Loading Approach
- Decide between **Incremental Load** (only new/changed data) or **Full Load** (all data).  
- Discuss:  
  - Data scope (how much history is needed — 10 years, all-time, etc.)  
  - Historical data handling (already available in source or built in warehouse).  
- Estimate data size — MB, GB, or TB — to ensure the right tools and infrastructure are in place.

---

### ⚡ Step 8: Address Performance and Limitations
- Identify any data volume or performance limitations in the source system.  
- Some older systems may slow down with heavy queries or large extracts.  
- Ensure your ETL process doesn’t affect the source system’s performance.

---

### 🔐 Step 9: Authentication and Authorization
Clarify how you’ll access the data:
- Tokens  
- Keys  
- Passwords  
- Certificates  

Maintain security and compliance when setting up connections.

---

### ✅ Summary
By asking these questions and understanding your sources deeply, you’ll:
- Build a **strong foundation** for your data warehouse.  
- Ensure **efficient, secure, and reliable** data integration.  
- Avoid **technical issues, performance problems, and governance risks** later.
