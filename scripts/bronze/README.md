## 🔍 Step 1: Analysis — Understanding the Source System

Before developing the Bronze Layer, the first and most important step is **analysis**.  
You don’t immediately start writing code — instead, you must first **understand the source system** you are connecting to the data warehouse.

### 🎯 Purpose

To gain a deep understanding of:

- The nature and structure of the source system.  
- How data is generated, stored, and accessed.  
- The best way to extract and load it into the data warehouse.

### 🗣️ Approach

The Data Engineer or Architect should **interview the source system experts** and ask multiple questions to learn:

- What kind of system it is (CRM, ERP, etc.)  
- What data formats it uses.  
- How frequently the data changes.  
- What access or security constraints exist.  

This step helps avoid integration issues and ensures efficient ETL pipeline design.

## ⚙️ Step 2: Data Ingestion — Connecting Source to Data Warehouse

Once the source systems are well-understood, the next focus is **data ingestion**.  
This means **building the bridge** between the source system and the data warehouse.

### 🧩 Key Objective

- Load data from the source into the **Bronze Layer**.  
- Preserve the data **exactly as it exists in the source system** (no transformations).

The Bronze Layer serves as the **raw data zone**, capturing all incoming data in its original form.

## 🧪 Step 3: Data Validation — Ensuring Data Quality

Once data ingestion scripts are ready and data is loaded, it’s time for **quality control**.

### ✅ Validation Steps

**Data Completeness Check:**  
Compare the number of records between the source system and the Bronze Layer.  
This ensures that no data has been lost during ingestion.

**Schema Check:**  
Validate that the table structure, column order, and data types match exactly between the source and the Bronze Layer.  
This ensures that data has landed correctly and maintains consistency.

---

## 🧾 Step 4: Documentation & Version Control

After successful ingestion and validation:

- **Document** all details — source connections, table mappings, and validation results.  
- **Commit** the scripts and documentation to **Git** for version control and collaboration.

> 🧠 Good documentation and versioning ensure your work is **traceable**, **maintainable**, and **reproducible**.
