## 🔍 Step 1: Analysis — Understanding the Source Systems

Before writing any code, the first step in developing the **Bronze Layer** is **analysis** — understanding the source systems we will connect to the data warehouse.

As a Data Architect or Engineer, you don’t jump straight into coding; you first **interview the source system experts** to learn about the system’s nature, data structure, and technical setup.

This phase ensures you can design robust ingestion scripts and avoid data integration issues later.

### 🗣️ Questions to Ask During Source System Analysis

#### 1. Understanding the Business Context & Ownership
- What’s the story behind this data?  
- Who owns the data — which IT department or business unit?  
- What business process does it support (Customer Transactions, Supply Chain, Logistics, Finance, etc.)?  

> 🧠 *This helps identify data importance, responsibility, and usage scope.*

#### 2. System and Data Documentation
- Is there any existing data documentation or data catalog?  
- Are there column descriptions, table definitions, or entity-relationship diagrams?  

> 🧩 *Having these documents saves a lot of time during modeling and ETL design.*

#### 3. Source Data Model
- How is the data structured in the source system?  
- What are the key relationships between tables?  
- Are there primary/foreign keys, constraints, or hierarchies?  

> 🧱 *Understanding this helps define joins and transformations correctly.*

---

## ⚙️ Step 2: Technical Understanding — Architecture & Technology Stack

Once you know the business context, dive into the **technical side**.

### Key Questions to Discuss with Source Experts

#### 🔸 Data Storage & Hosting
- Is the data **on-premises** (SQL Server, Oracle, etc.) or **cloud-based** (Azure, AWS, etc.)?

#### 🔸 Integration Capabilities
- How can we access the data?  
  - APIs?  
  - Kafka streams?  
  - File extractions (CSV, JSON, etc.)?  
  - Direct database connection?

> 🧭 *Understanding this determines the ETL approach.*

#### 🔸 Data Extraction Strategy
- Will the data be **fully reloaded (Full Load)** or **incrementally loaded (Incremental Load)**?  
- What is the expected **data volume** — MBs, GBs, or TBs?  
- Are there any **performance limitations** on the source system during extraction?  

> ⚠️ *Older systems might struggle with large data loads — be mindful of system performance impact.*

#### 🔸 Data Retention & History
- Do we need all historical data, or just a recent range (e.g., last 10 years)?  
- Does the source system already maintain historical data, or do we handle it in the data warehouse?

#### 🔸 Authentication & Authorization
- How will we access the source system?  
  - Username/password?  
  - API tokens or access keys?  
  - Certificates or OAuth?  

> 🔐 *Ensure security and access control are properly handled.*

## 🧩 Step 3: Data Ingestion — Loading into the Bronze Layer

Once the analysis is complete and the access method is clear, we move to **data ingestion** — building a bridge between the source system and the data warehouse.

### 🎯 Objective
Load **raw source data exactly as it is** into the **Bronze Layer** of the Data Warehouse.

### 🧠 Key Specifications for the Bronze Layer

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|--------------|
| **Purpose** | Store raw data from the source systems. |
| **Loading Type** | Full Load (truncate and reload each time). |
| **Transformations** | None — data remains exactly as in the source. |
| **Modeling** | None — no joins or data modeling yet. |
| **Validation** | Ensure data completeness and schema correctness. |
| **Documentation** | Every table and column must be documented. |
| **Version Control** | Commit all scripts to Git regularly. |

---

### ✅ Data Validation

Once data is loaded:
- Compare **record counts** between the source and the Bronze Layer to confirm completeness.  
- Verify **schema structure** — column order, data types, and naming consistency.

---

## 💻 Step 4: Building the Bronze Layer Tables

Before writing the **DDL (Data Definition Language)** scripts, explore the metadata and structure of incoming data.

You can either:
- Consult **technical documentation**, or  
- Inspect the **source files (e.g., CSVs)** to infer column names and data types.

📘 *This structured approach ensures that your Bronze Layer is reliable, auditable, and serves as a strong foundation for Silver and Gold layers in your data warehouse.*
