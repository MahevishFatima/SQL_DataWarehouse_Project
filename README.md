# Data Warehouse and Analytics Project
Building a modern data warehouse with SQL Server, including ETL Processes, data modelling and analytics.

# 🏗️ SQL Data Warehouse Project — End-to-End Architecture

## 👋 Welcome!
Welcome to my **SQL Data Warehouse Project**!  
This project showcases how to design, build, and document a complete **data warehouse architecture** using SQL Server — from raw data ingestion to clean, business-ready data layers.

## 📖 Project Description
In this project, I designed and implemented a **three-tiered data warehouse** based on industry best practices.  
The architecture follows the **Bronze–Silver–Gold** data layering model:

### 🥉 Bronze Layer
- **Purpose:** Store raw data as received from source systems.  
- **Object Type:** Table  
- **Load Type:** Batch (Full Load)  
- **Transformations:** None  
- **Data Model:** None (as-is)

### 🥈 Silver Layer
- **Purpose:** Contain cleaned, standardized, and validated data.  
- **Object Type:** Table / View  
- **Load Type:** Incremental / Scheduled Batch  
- **Transformations:** Cleaning, Standardization, Deduplication  
- **Data Model:** Normalized  

### 🥇 Gold Layer
- **Purpose:** Provide business-ready, aggregated data for analytics.  
- **Object Type:** Star / Snowflake Schema  
- **Load Type:** Incremental  
- **Transformations:** Aggregations, Joins, Business Logic  
- **Data Model:** Dimensional (Facts & Dimensions)

The **Consumer Layer** serves BI and analytics tools like **Power BI**, **Tableau**, or **direct SQL queries** for ad-hoc analysis and machine learning use cases.

## 🧩 Data Modeling
To organize and optimize data, two popular schema designs were implemented:

### ⭐ Star Schema
A simple, denormalized structure where fact tables connect to dimension tables.  
- Fast querying  
- Ideal for dashboards & reports  
- Easy to understand for business users  

### ❄️ Snowflake Schema
A normalized version of the star schema where dimensions are broken into sub-dimensions.  
- Reduces redundancy  
- Improves data integrity  
- Better for complex analytical systems  

These schemas are essential in **data warehousing** to represent **fact and dimension tables** — enabling efficient reporting, metrics tracking, and BI insights.
